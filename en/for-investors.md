## Investment Offering

### VC HB3 Accelerator Governance Tokens

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Total tokens | 3,000,000 |
| Available to LP | up to 30% (900,000 tokens) |
| Price per token | 1,000 USDT |

Investment is tied to a specific line of business within one accelerator (5 years).

### Token Holder Rights

- **Dividends:** 15% of all treasury inflows, proportional to ownership share
- **Voting:** participation in on-chain voting on development priorities (51% quorum, may be raised to 70%)
- **Proposals:** ability to initiate votes
- **Protection:** raising quorum to 70% prevents single-party control
- **Liquidity:** treasury balance enables token redemption for stablecoins
- **Co-investment:** access to accelerator projects, participation in portfolio company rounds

---

## Revenue Sources

### 1. Dividends from Treasury Inflows

15% of all inflows are distributed proportionally to token ownership.

Inflows come from:
- DLE platform license sales
- Sales of portfolio company governance tokens (exits)
- Capital raised from LP investors

### 2. Token Price Appreciation

Token price = treasury balance / tokens in circulation. As treasury balance grows, each token’s value increases.

### 3. Portfolio of Portfolio Company Governance Tokens

- Selection of 600 companies from accelerator participants over 5 years
- Investments from Pre-seed to ICO
- In exchange for investment — governance tokens of portfolio companies
- Goal: build and sell portfolio to launch the next accelerator
