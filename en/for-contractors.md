## Who Are Contractors

Contractors are holders of VC HB3 Accelerator governance tokens who perform tasks from clients (entrepreneurs participating in the accelerator). Payment comes from the project treasury (15% of all inflows is allocated to expenses: contractors, acceleration, operating costs).

## Payment and Funding

### Source

15% of all treasury inflows goes to expenses. Contractor tasks are paid from this budget.

### Treasury inflows come from:

- DLE platform license sales (Standard: 1,000 USDT, Premium: 10,000 USDT)
- Sales of portfolio company governance tokens (exits)
- Capital raised from LP investors

### Additional Income

As a governance token holder, a contractor also receives:

- **Dividends** — 15% of all treasury inflows, proportional to ownership
- **Token appreciation** — as treasury balance grows
- **Voting rights** — participation in on-chain voting on development priorities
