## Governance Token Allocation

| Participant | Share | Tokens |
|-------------|-------|--------|
| Founder | 70% | 2,100,000 |
| Investors (LP) | up to 30% | 900,000 |
| **Total** | | **3,000,000** |

LP investors receive governance tokens and effectively become GP with voting rights — not only dividend rights but real participation in governance.

## Quorum and Voting Mechanism

### Quorum for Decisions

- **Initial quorum:** 51% of all governance tokens
- **Dynamic change:** quorum is set by token holders through voting
- **Protection from single-party control:** quorum can be raised to 70%, meaning the founder (70%) cannot decide without investor consent

### How It Works

1. Token holders can propose a quorum change via the voting system
2. Changing quorum requires a vote with the current quorum (51% or higher)
3. At 70% quorum the founder cannot decide alone
4. This protects investor (30%) interests

### Technical Implementation

- On-chain voting via smart contracts (ERC20Votes)
- One token = one vote
- Results recorded on blockchain and verifiable

## Voting Procedure

**Who can create proposals:** all governance token holders.

### Process

1. **Create proposal** — any token holder
2. **Discussion period** — proposal is discussed
3. **Voting** — holders vote for or against
4. **Count** — proportional to token count
5. **Decision** — if votes for ≥ quorum

## Balance of Founder and Investor Rights

### At 51% Quorum

Founder (70%) can decide alone, since 70% > 51%.

### At 70% Quorum

Founder cannot decide without investor consent. Investors (30%) effectively have veto power.

### Investor Rights

- Participation in voting with up to 30% weight
- Creating proposals for voting
- Blocking decisions at 70% quorum
- Access to reports and financial data
- Access to accelerator projects
- Co-investment in deals

### Minority Protection Mechanisms

1. Raise quorum to 70% via vote
2. Right to create proposals and initiate votes
3. Transparency — all decisions on blockchain
4. Access to financial reports and metrics

## Reporting

- Regular reports on treasury inflows
- Profit distribution (15% / 15% / 70%)
- Portfolio company reports
- All transactions transparent via blockchain
