## Overview

VC HB3 Accelerator is a venture fund and software provider. The business model is based on selling DLE platform licenses, investing in portfolio companies, and distributing profit among ecosystem participants.

### Value Proposition

| Audience | What they get |
|----------|----------------|
| **Entrepreneurs** | Ready platform on their server, accelerator program, access to investment |
| **Contractors** | Tasks from accelerator participants, payment from treasury, on-chain governance |
| **Investors (LP)** | Dividends (15% of inflows), liquidity via treasury, token appreciation |

---

## Revenue Sources

### 1. DLE Platform License Sales

| Plan | Contents | Price |
|------|----------|-------|
| Standard | 1 admin token, access to settings and updates for 5 years | 1,000 USDT |
| Premium | 10 admin tokens, access to settings and updates for 5 years | 10,000 USDT |

Clients buy admin tokens (licenses) → tokens are transferred to DLE smart contract → holders get platform access.

First accelerator target: 21,000+ entrepreneurs. Scaling scenarios — see [market-analysis.md](market-analysis.md).

### 2. Sales of Portfolio Company Governance Tokens

Portfolio companies deploy governance tokens using the DLE platform. In exchange for investment, startups transfer governance tokens to the fund. Tokens can be sold on the secondary market.

- Target: select 600 companies from accelerator participants over 5 years
- Stages: Pre-seed to ICO
- Average investment: ~1,148,000 USDT per company (70% treasury / 600)
- Goal: build and sell portfolio in 5 years to launch next accelerator

### 3. Capital from Investors

LP can acquire up to 30% of fund governance tokens at 1,000 USDT per token.

- Maximum: 30% of 3,000,000 tokens = 900,000 tokens
- Potential capital: up to 900,000,000 USDT

## Profit Distribution

### Formula: 15% / 15% / 70%

| Share | Purpose | Details |
|-------|---------|---------|
| 15% | Dividends to token holders | Proportional to ownership, from all treasury inflows |
| 15% | Expenses | Contractors, acceleration, operating costs, entity registration, hosting |
| 70% | Investments in portfolio companies | Selection of 600 companies, Pre-seed to ICO, stablecoin funding |

---

## Fund Treasury

### Initial Balance Formation

| Source | Amount |
|--------|--------|
| License sales to first accelerator entrepreneurs (21,000) | 84,000,000 USDT |
| Governance token sales to LP (30%) | 900,000,000 USDT |
| **Total** | **984,000,000 USDT** |

Sequence: first entrepreneurs buy licenses, then LP investors buy governance tokens.

### Treasury Inflows

1. **From license sales** — Standard (1,000 USDT) and Premium (10,000 USDT)
2. **From portfolio company exits** — sale of governance tokens on exit (exit rate 10–20%, return 10–15x)
3. **From LP investors** — sale of up to 30% of fund governance tokens

### Liquidity Provision

Full treasury balance backs 3,000,000 governance tokens. Treasury guarantees ability to redeem tokens for stablecoins via smart contract.

## Licensing Model

### On-Premises Deployment

1. Client acquires license (admin tokens)
2. Receives source code and Docker containers
3. Deploys platform on own infrastructure
4. Receives updates for 5 years

Benefits: full data control, customization, compliance with data localization requirements.

---

## Accelerator Program

### Iterative Growth Model

Expansion cycle per country:

1. Register legal entity (with local company contributors)
2. Deploy DLE platform on local hosting
3. Find 2+ buyers per line of business
4. Form groups and deploy smart contracts
5. Reinvest profit into registration in next country
6. Work with regulator (sandboxes in IT hubs)

Goal: presence in 150+ countries.

### Program Structure

4 cohorts × 70 groups = 280 groups

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Lines of business per cohort | 70 |
| Entrepreneurs per group | 25–50 (Premium / Standard) |
| Cohorts | 4 |
| Total entrepreneurs | from 21,000 |
| Program duration | 5 years |

### Support System

Token holders govern platform development via on-chain voting:

- **Clients** publish development and support tasks; payment from treasury (15% expenses)
- **Contractors** perform tasks and get paid
- **AI agents** automate support and analytics

## Ecosystem Architecture

### 1. Regional Operator Companies

Companies like LLC "ERAYTI" in each regulator zone: deploy platform on local hosting, sell licenses, local presence and regulatory compliance.

### 2. Smart Contract Deployment

Regional companies deploy smart contracts with governance tokens → 100% of tokens transferred to VC HB3 Accelerator → tokens sold to entrepreneurs as licenses.

### 3. Centralized Governance

VC HB3 Accelerator deploys 3,000,000 governance tokens. Governance via on-chain voting. Delivery of token-licenses to clients, payment to treasury.
