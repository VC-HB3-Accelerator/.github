## Target Market

### MSMEs Worldwide

Micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) account for over 90% of all companies globally, ~70% of employment and ~50% of global GDP.

| Indicator | Value | Source |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| Formal MSMEs worldwide | ~322 million (176 economies) | World Bank MSME-EI, 2019 |
| Of these, formal SMEs | ~36–44 million | IFC, World Bank |
| MSME share of all companies | >90% | UN Global MSMEs Report, 2024 |
| MSME financing gap | $5.7 tn (formal), $8 tn (with informal) | IFC, 2024 |

Financial calculations use an estimate of ~333 million entrepreneurs. This aligns with World Bank data (322 million formal MSMEs in 176 economies in 2019) plus annual growth in registered businesses (World Bank Entrepreneurship Database, 2022).

### TAM / SAM / SOM

| Level | Description | Volume | Rationale |
|-------|-------------|--------|-----------|
| **TAM** (Total Addressable Market) | All formal MSMEs worldwide | ~333 million companies | World Bank: 322M (2019) + annual registration growth |
| **SAM** (Serviceable Addressable Market) | MSMEs in jurisdictions with regulatory sandboxes and blockchain-friendly regulation | ~100–130 million companies | 92 countries with sandboxes, ~70% MSMEs in EMDE |
| **SOM** (Serviceable Obtainable Market) | Companies the accelerator can realistically attract in 5 years | 21,000 – 3.3 million | 21,000 — first accelerator; 3.3M — 1% of TAM |

**SAM criteria:**
- Jurisdiction with regulatory sandbox or blockchain-friendly regulation
- Company uses or is ready to use digital management tools
- Server infrastructure (own or leased) for on-premises

**SOM criteria:**
- Accelerator presence in the country
- Integration of local identifiers (tax, accounting, banking) into the platform
- Active marketing and support in local language

---

## Scenario Rationale

### Financial Calculation Scenarios

[Financial calculations](financial-calculations.md) use 5-year coverage scenarios:

| Scenario | Share of TAM | Customers | Likelihood |
|----------|-------------|-----------|------------|
| Realistic (SOM) | ~1% | ~3.3 million | High (50–70%) |
| Conservative | 10% | ~33.3 million | Medium (30–50%) |
| Optimistic | 40% | ~133.2 million | Low (10–20%) |

### Comparison with Market

| Platform | Customers | Years in market | Product type |
|----------|-----------|-----------------|--------------|
| Shopify | ~2.1M (Q4 2024) | 20 | E-commerce SaaS |
| Stripe | ~4M+ (est.) | 15 | Payments API |
| QuickBooks (Intuit) | ~7M | 30+ | Accounting SaaS |
| Salesforce | ~150K | 26 | CRM SaaS |

**Conclusions:**

- **SOM (1%, ~3.3M)** — comparable to Shopify/Stripe over 15–20 years. Ambitious for 5 years but achievable with a large accelerator in 150+ countries
- **10% (~33.3M)** — significantly above growth rates of mature SaaS platforms
- **40% (~133.2M)** — very unlikely in this horizon
- Key differentiator of DLE: one-time license purchase (not subscription), lowering entry barrier

### SOM Scenario (1% coverage) — Base

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Customers by year 5 | ~3.3 million |
| License revenue | ~9,332,000,000 USDT |
| To treasury (70%) | ~6,532,400,000 USDT |
| Minimum token price | ~2,505 USDT |

Even at 1% coverage, minimum token price grows ~7.6x from initial (328 USDT), delivering returns above target IRR 20–30%.

## Tokenization Market

### Current State (2026)

| Indicator | Value | Source |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| Asset tokenization market (2025) | $1.47 tn | Research and Markets |
| 2026 forecast | $2.02 tn (CAGR 37.3%) | Research and Markets |
| Tokenized RWA market cap | >$21 bn | ByteTree, Jan 2026 |
| RWA token holders | >630,000 | ByteTree, Jan 2026 |
| Tokenized US Treasuries | ~$9 bn | ByteTree, 2026 |
| BlackRock + JPMorgan (tokenized) | ~$24 bn | AInvest, 2026 |

### 2030 Forecasts

| Source | Forecast | CAGR |
|--------|----------|------|
| McKinsey | $2 tn (base), $4 tn (optimistic) | — |
| BCG / Ripple | $18 tn | 53% |
| Standard Chartered | $30 tn | — |
| Research and Markets | $7.79 tn | 12.4% |

### DLE Position

DLE does not compete directly with financial asset (RWA) tokenization platforms. DLE tokenizes **business governance** — corporate decisions, licensing, access to settings. This is an adjacent but distinct segment.

---

## Regulatory Sandboxes

| Indicator | Value | Source |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| Sandboxes worldwide | 199+ | SSRN, Jan 2025 |
| Countries with sandboxes | 92 | SSRN, Jan 2025 |
| Leaders | USA, Singapore, UK (~25% of all) | SSRN, 2025 |
| EMDE share | ~70% | World Bank |
| 70% of sandboxes | focus on blockchain/fintech | World Bank |
| Peak creation | 2018–2020 (56% in 2018–2019) | World Bank |

**Relevance for DLE:**

- 92 countries with sandboxes — potential entry points for the accelerator
- Emerging markets (70% of sandboxes) — core DLE audience
- Growth in sandboxes creates infrastructure for blockchain adoption

---

## Competitive Landscape

### DAO Platforms and Governance Tools

DAO ecosystem in 2026: 13,000+ organizations, ~$24.5 bn in treasuries, 11.1M governance token holders (CoinLaw, 2026). Tokenized on-chain treasuries — $9.1 bn TVL (Dec 2025, up from $770M in 2023). Sector growth ~30% CAGR (2021–2024).

| Platform | Focus | Difference from DLE |
|----------|-------|---------------------|
| Snapshot | Voting (96% of large DAOs) | Voting only, no business tools |
| Safe (Gnosis) | Treasury ($22+ bn) | Multisig wallet, no AI/CRM |
| Tally | Governance ($5+ bn) | On-chain governance only |
| DeXe | No-code DAO builder, multi-chain | Closest to DLE but no AI agents, no on-premises |
| Aragon / XDAO | DAO framework | Developer infrastructure |

### Blockchain Platforms for Business

| Platform | Focus | Difference from DLE |
|----------|-------|---------------------|
| Fireblocks | Transaction security | Custody and transfers only |
| Chainalysis | Compliance, KYT | Analytics, not business management |
| Ripple | Cross-border payments | No governance smart contracts |
| Hyperledger | Enterprise blockchain | Framework for developers, not ready product |

### DLE’s Unique Position

No existing platform combines:

1. **AI agents** (local model, RAG, customization for business processes)
2. **Smart contracts with regulator identifiers** (tax, accounting, banking)
3. **On-premises deployment** (data on client server)
4. **One-time license** (no SaaS subscriptions)
5. **Accelerator program** (setup, training, investment)

---

## Growth Drivers

1. **Regulatory pressure** — FATF, MiCA, SEC/CFTC require identification of blockchain participants. DLE addresses this via smart contracts with identifiers.

2. **Tokenization growth** — market growing at 53% CAGR (BCG). Business needs tools to manage tokenized assets.

3. **Regulatory sandboxes** — 199 sandboxes in 92 countries provide testing infrastructure. DLE is a ready product for these sandboxes.

4. **SaaS fatigue** — small business spends $10,000–50,000/year on subscriptions. DLE one-time license ($1,000–10,000) is an attractive alternative.

5. **Local AI** — growing demand for AI without sending data to the cloud. Ollama + on-premises = full data control.

---

## Barriers

1. **Scaling** — reaching even 1% coverage (~3.3M customers) in 5 years requires massive distribution across 150+ countries.

2. **Regulatory uncertainty** — legal status of tokens varies by jurisdiction. Bans in key markets could limit growth.

3. **Competition** — large players (Shopify, Stripe, Intuit) may add blockchain features. DAO platforms (DeXe, Aragon) may extend functionality.

4. **Education barrier** — most entrepreneurs are unfamiliar with tokenization and DAOs. Significant education effort required.

5. **Technical complexity** — on-premises deployment requires technical capability, limiting micro-enterprise audience.

6. **Key Person Risk** — dependence on founder with 70% of governance tokens.
