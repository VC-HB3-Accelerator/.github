## Initial Conditions

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Total governance tokens | 3,000,000 |
| Available to LP | 30% = 900,000 tokens |
| Primary sale price for LP | 1,000 USDT per token |
| Minimum investment | 10,000 USDT (10 tokens) |
| Maximum investment | 100,000 USDT (100 tokens) |
| Profit distribution | 15% dividends / 15% expenses / 70% investments |

### Initial Treasury Balance Formation

Sequence:
1. First accelerator entrepreneurs (21,000) buy licenses → 84,000,000 USDT
2. LP investors buy governance tokens (30%) → 900,000,000 USDT

**Initial treasury balance: 984,000,000 USDT**

Initial minimum token price (treasury-backed): 984,000,000 / 3,000,000 = **328 USDT**

Primary sale premium: 1,000 / 328 = 3.05x (premium for future growth)

---

## Token Pricing Mechanism

### Minimum Price (Treasury-Backed)

**Formula:** treasury balance / 3,000,000

Guarantees liquidity — treasury redeems tokens at this price. Grows as treasury receives inflows (70% of all revenue).

### Market Price

Can be significantly above minimum — reflects expected future inflows from licenses and exits. Multiplier 6–9x of minimum price (depends on investor expectations).

Holders may sell tokens on the secondary market at market price.

---

## Liquidity Mechanism

### Treasury Redemption

- Investor sells tokens back to treasury at minimum price via smart contract
- Treasury balance backs redemption of all 3,000,000 tokens
- Redemption in stablecoins (USDT)

### Lock-up Period: 60 Months (5 Years)

- During lock-up, tokens cannot be sold back to treasury
- Applies only to treasury redemption
- Purpose: fund stability, protection from speculation

### After Lock-up

- Sale to treasury at minimum price
- Sale on secondary market at market price
- Transfer to third parties without restriction
- All rights (dividends, voting) transfer to new owner

## Return Scenarios

### Income Sources for Investor

1. **Dividends** — 15% of all treasury inflows, proportional to share
2. **Minimum price growth** — as treasury balance grows
3. **Market price growth** — multiplier above minimum

### Two Scenarios

### Common Portfolio Parameters

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Portfolio companies | 600 |
| Initial capital for investments (70% of treasury) | 688,800,000 USDT |

| License revenue over 5 years | ~93,324,000,000 USDT |
| Exit rate | 10% (60 companies) |
| Average return from exit | 10x |
| Inflows from exits | ~688,800,000 USDT |

**Treasury balance by year 5:**

| Component | Amount (USDT) |

| Initial balance | 984,000,000 |
| From licenses (70%) | 65,242,800,000 |
| From exits (70%) | 482,160,000 |
| **Total** | **66,709,160,000** |

**Minimum token price:** 66,709,160,000 / 3,000,000 = **22,236 USDT**

**Estimated market token price:** ~200,000 USDT

#### Optimistic Scenario (5 Years)

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Entrepreneur coverage by year 5 | 40% of global market (~133.2M) |
| License revenue over 5 years | ~373,044,000,000 USDT |
| Exit rate | 20% (120 companies) |

### Stress Test

| Scenario | Impact on returns |
|----------|-------------------|
| Sales 2x below forecast | Minimum price ~11,000 USDT, returns ~1,000% over 5 years |
| Exit rate 5% instead of 10–20% | Slight decrease — main revenue from licenses |
| Token ban in some jurisdictions | Refund terms, focus on friendly jurisdictions |

---

## Summary

| Scenario | Likelihood | Returns (min. price) | Returns (market price) |
|----------|------------|----------------------|-------------------------|
| Conservative (10%) | Medium (30–50%) | ~2,593% over 5 years | ~20,370% over 5 years |
| Optimistic (40%) | Low (10–20%) | ~10,556% over 5 years | ~151,774% over 5 years |

**Key takeaways:**

- Main return driver is license sales, not exits
- Minimum token price is backed by treasury balance
- Even in conservative scenario, returns far exceed target IRR 20–30%
- Actual results may differ significantly from all forecasts — possibly tens or hundreds of times lower
- **All forecasts are a vision of the future, not a guarantee**
