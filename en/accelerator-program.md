## How It Works

1. **Regulator** provides a grant → fund opens presence and integrates local identifiers into the platform
2. **Entrepreneurs** buy a license → deploy DLE → register in a group on the platform by line of business
3. **Contractors** pick tasks on the platform and get paid for completing them
4. **Investors** review metrics and select companies for investment

### Governance via Voting

All key decisions are made by token holders through on-chain voting on the platform:

- Development and update priorities
- Treasury fund allocation
- Company selection for investment
- Program term changes

1 token = 1 vote. Quorum — 51%. More: [governance.md](governance.md)
